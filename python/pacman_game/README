PACMAN

* All in problem statement completed

* Bored of the boring fixed design in level type gaming ?
-> We have unlimited designs and patterns, god say thanks to random.

* Want to play on random map but want to feel like if you are playing on a level type gaming ?
-> No worry, we have an option to let program memorize your last board, it wouldn't change it ever, so you can have unlimited fun on it.

* Multiple Ghost
-> Yes, you read it right..!
-> There are many hungry bots (GHOSTS) on the map, who love PACMAN's blood, so be attentioned during your play

* You would have again used random in it, so what, I can skip ghosts....
-> No, no, that was old fashioned, so a priority queue is given to ghost to memorize, and they would move according smelling PACMAN's blood.
-> Yeah, no shortest path algorithm, so you can still skip them, think there movement pattern.. :)

* I hate black and white.
-> No worry, I have tried to make it a little colorfull so you can enjoy during the play

* How to complete one round ?
-> It is still simple, but harder then being eaten by ghosts.
-> Just collect all coins.

* What is connection between ghosts and all coins ?
-> Well, I think they can also be won by giving enough money to them, so that they can buy themselves blood juice and leave you.

ALL THE BEST
HAPPY PLAYING..!
